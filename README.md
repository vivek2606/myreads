## Project Overview

In the MyReads project, we'll create a bookshelf app that allows us to select and categorize books we have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that we will use to persist information as we interact with the application.

### App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

-   Currently Reading
-   Want to Read
-   Read

Each book has a control that lets us select the shelf for that book. When we select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control is always the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a link to `/search`, a search page that allows us to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets us add the book to the library.

When a book is on a bookshelf, it has the same state on both the main application page and the search page.

The search page also has a link to / (the root URL), which leads back to the main page.

When we navigate back to the main page from the search page, we can instantly see all of the selections we made on the search page in our library.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
